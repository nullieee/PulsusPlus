# PulsusPlus - *The* QoL toolkit for Pulsus

PulsusPlus is a web browser extension for Pulsus Gamma, that focuses on bringing a better experience to its players, mappers and enjoyers. It features many features (that you can [read about in the last section of the README](https://github.com/nullieee/PulsusPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#features)), along with frequent updates, as to cover for the playerbase while Pulsus Delta is being developed and Gamma can finally be dropped. While that doesn't happen, we've got your back!

## User Safety

This section is *definitely* needed considering the amount of bans PulseHax caused, so it's important to emphasize right here on the first paragraph that **yes, you are completely safe using PulsusPlus** and will not get banned. PulsusPlus has not one, not two, not three, but **five security measures** to prevent users from submitting scores (all of which are pretty effective on their own), so it's safe to say that no one will be getting banned anytime soon.

PulsusPlus very strictly follows the **Pulsus Terms of Service Regarding Third-Party Modifications**:

- PulsusPlus **disables score submissions** globally;
- PulsusPlus **does not modify any data or requests sent to the server**.

By following all of these conditions, PulsusPlus ensures a safe enviroment for players to use without risk of getting banned. Any modifications made to the PulsusPlus extension will shift all responsibility of the risk of bans to the user who changed it, as it is not within our power to prevent client modifications made to the game.

## Download (Chromium)

If you're familiar with cloning repositories, that is the preferred method, as you can just run git pull every time an update gets released as opposed to having to redownload it every time. Otherwise:

In order to download PulsusPlus, all that is needed is to go to the [latest release](https://github.com/nullieee/PulsusPlus/releases/latest) of the extension inside this repository and download it, after which you should get a ZIP file. In order to load it on your browser, simply head to the "Extensions" page of your browser, activate "Developer Mode" if you haven't already, and drop the ZIP file inside. That should correctly import PulsusPlus into your browser! If that doesn't work, you can extract the ZIP file and load the extracted folder through the "Load Unpacked" button. If you have any further issues downloading the extension, please don't hesitate to let us know through our [support Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rMbHNb6AgU)!

> As of now, PulsusPlus is only fully supported and tested on Chromium based browsers. Maybe FireFox is compatible with it, but beware, as FireFox support is not something we're testing or really care about.

## Usage

After you've loaded the extension into your browser, just open up Pulsus Gamma, and press `Shift + Tab`! That'll bring up the completely in-game keybinds menu, of which will give you directions to all other menus, and from there, it's your own game! Modify settings, themes, gameplay elements, etc. at your own pace!

## Features

PulsusPlus is a very feature-heavy extension, so while listing all of them here is impossible, it's definitely possible to list off the top features that PulsusPlus has:

### General features

- An awesome popup window for all PulsusPlus-exclusive features, of which is able to be dragged around, minimized, maximized, all that good stuff! And of course, a scrollbar (undeniably the best thing to have been coded since the dawn of time);
- Use **real math inside number inputs**! Simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, all the way to logarithms for our complex effect mappers;
- **Master volume**! Seriously, that's such a basic and important feature;
- **Import and export anything** you can think of, like settings, themes, hitsounds (yes, **custom hitsounds**!), maps, ~~your account information~~; the possibilities are endless!
- Set a fixed **pixel-accurate screen resolution** for your game for all my fellow tryhards. along with being able to freely change the background image of the game, and the name and icon it has on your tabs list! Specially good at recording videos of the game with it outside of fullscreen;
- Scroll through the maps list *professionally* with the up and down arrow keys (and F2 for selecting random maps for good measure);
- An awesome custom theme editor and online browser for custom themes (you read it right), in case you just want to look at the best themes out there!

### Gameplay features

- Waste no more time inside of maps with PulsusPlus' **quick retry** and our completely unique and never seen before **section skips**, for skipping empty sections of a map (as well as the intro)! Keybinds for those customizable in the Keybinds menu;
- Feel like Dual Controls is a little weird sometimes? We've got your back! Use the **Fix Dual Controls** setting, which will make it so your DC works as Delta intended;
- Get more in-depth information about your gameplay with the **Show Detailed Judgements** setting, which will show your hit numbers for each judgement, the map's HW, your UR, and your M:G! Or nicely show what mods you're using with the **Show Mods** setting, and last but not least, for all the people that struggled finding a good key overlay for the game, a built-in **Control Overlay**, with customizable colors for letters and numpad, seperately! Here's how it looks all together:

> P.S: There's a KPS counter above the Control Overlay now, that got added after the video got recorded and I'm too lazy to rerecord it

### Editor Features

- Use PulsusPlus' very own **Custom Note/Effect Selector**, with an incredible amount of filters to choose from (stream ends, anchors, nested anchors, chordstreams, the list goes on!);
- Forget your days of manually coloring in **gradients**, as we have a feature for it! Select 2 colors and a range of notes, and we'll do the rest for you;
- Do you hate how weird BPM changes are with Gamma? Me too! Abuse of our own **Use Timing Points** setting, which will remove the functionality of the Timeline BPM and Offset, in exchange for a more realiable way of doing timings, bookmarks. (This setting will also automatically align the bpm of your timeline and show a detailed breakdown of note tick, BPM and timing point offset in the top left corner of the editor!);
